KOOG LIBRARY SETUP

To use Koog, you must have PLT Scheme version 4 installed. Get it from
http://plt-scheme.org/ if you do not already have it installed, or say
on Debian-based Linux distributions it might be sufficient to do

  sudo aptitude install mzscheme

provided that the version included in the distribution is recent
enough. (mzscheme --version should tell you the version number.)

Begin Koog installation by unpacking the tar file under some directory
that is on your PLTCOLLECTS path.

For example:

  mkdir $HOME/pltcollects
  cd $HOME/pltcollects
  tar xzvf /tmp/koog.tar.gz
  export $PLTCOLLECTS=$HOME/pltcollects:$PLTCOLLECTS

Now you should be able to do:

  mzscheme --eval '(require koog/koog)'

KOOG COMMAND LINE TOOL SETUP

To run Koog from the command line, you can use the cli-shell.sh shell
script, on a suitably Unix-like system at least. To create a "koog"
executable, you might for instance:

  mkdir -p $(HOME)/bin
  ln -sf $HOME/pltcollects/koog/cli-shell.sh $(HOME)/bin/koog
  export PATH=$PATH:$(HOME)/bin

and now it should be possible to run

  koog --help

EMACS INTEGRATION SETUP

To set up Koog for use within the Emacs editor, with the C++ language,
say, you might add something like the following to your ~/.emacs file:

  (setq load-path
        (nconc
         (list
          (concat (getenv "HOME") "/pltcollects/koog/emacs")
         )
         load-path))

  (require 'koog)

  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key c++-mode-map [(control o) (m)]
                'koog-map-prefix)
              ))

Having done this, in the C++ mode you should be able to insert Koog
markers with the command C-o m i, and so forth. See the koog.el file
for more information.

VIM INTEGRATION SETUP

To set up Koog for use within the Vim editor, you might add something
like the following to your ~/.vimrc file:

  if filereadable(expand("$HOME/pltcollects/koog/vim/koog.vimrc"))
    source $HOME/pltcollects/koog/vim/koog.vimrc
  endif

Having done this, you should be able to insert Koog markers with the
command m i, and so forth. See the koog.vimrc file for more
information.
